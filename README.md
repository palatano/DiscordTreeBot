# TreeBot
Automated Discord Bot that provides multiple features for music, searching, and customization.

# Description
An automated discord bot in Java that interprets commands via the messaging UI on Discord. The program uses a wide variety of APIs, including the Discord API wrapper, JDA, Google, and YouTube. The program specializes in a creative "DJ" music system that plays music directly inside the Discord client from YouTube. In addition, there are utility features for searching on Google and YouTube within the Discord client. The project requires a lot of third-party programs and development outside of the core Java program, such as basic HTML/CSS/Javascript knowledge for the website, as well as Linode to provide a remote virtual private server to run the program 24/7 on the Discord client.
